## Simulate data of a moving average (MA) process
```{r}
set.seed(1)
b <- c(0.8, 0.6, 0.4)
x <- w <- rnorm(1000)
for (t in 4:1000) {for (j in 1:3) x[t] <- x[t] + b[j] * w[t - j]}
plot(x, type = "l")
```
## Get the autocorrelation
```{r}
acf(x)
```
As expected, the MA(3) model has the first 3 lags as significant


## Fit the simulated data to a MA process
```{r}
x.ma <- arima(x, order = c(0, 0, 3))
x.ma
```

```{r}
b
```
The estimated parameters are very similar to the parameters used for the simulation
